Project Link - https://thedevstore.netlify.com

Dependencies used in this project:

  - react-paypal-express-checkout
  - react-router-dom
  - styled-components
  
This project was initiated through a tutorial by John Smilga. We took a deep dive into react - focusing on modular design.
A big takeaway for me in this project was how we used component level CSS with styled-components. We also dove into the context API 
to manage state universally minimizing prop drilling. We also learned the importance of immutable state because of the case in which you 
would want to reference original values.
